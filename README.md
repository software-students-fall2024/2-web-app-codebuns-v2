## Steps necessary to run the software

### Set up a Python virtual environment

Here are instructions for using `pipenv`

### Using [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

Install `pipenv` using `pip`:

```
pip3 install pipenv
```

Activate it:

```
pipenv shell
```

### Or use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Here are instructions for using `venv`

Create a virtual environment named `.venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

On Mac:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies into the currently-active virtual environment, use `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps necessary for MongoDB and pynomgo

### Install pymongo

```bash
python3 -m pip install pymongo
```

### Create .env file

Create a [.env](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/software-engineering/slides/flask-pymongo/#combined) to store credentials for connecting to the database.

```
MONGO_DBNAME=
MONGO_URI=

#other options
FLASK_APP="app.py"
FLASK_ENV="development"
FLASK_PORT=
SECRET_KEY=
```

### Install dotenv

Use [`dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) retrieve the values from the [.env](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/software-engineering/slides/flask-pymongo/#combined) file.

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

### Run the app

Start flask with `flask run` - this will output an address at which the app is running locally, e.g. https://127.0.0.1:5000. Visit that address in a web browser.
